Breaking any of the rules below may result in punishment through the use of server/discord bans, notes, and smiting. All rules-related decisions are at the discretion of administrators.

There is no current official appeals process, but if you show that you are willing to improve you will likely be given a second chance. Bans relating to harassment, NSFW content, hacking, and the age minimum are less likely to be appealable.

# Game/Discord Rules

## 1 No Harassment

Banter is fine and even expected in a game like this, but do not harass or intentionally make anyone uncomfortable.

## 2 No Hate Speech

Absolutely no slurs or hatespeech will be tolerated, even if not directed at anyone. If it's on the filter it's not okay to say here in almost any context.

## 3 No NSFW Content

Do not post or link to anything that could be considered NSFW.

## 4 No Politics

Avoid starting political discussions, and change the topic if staff directs it.

## 5 Age Minimum 18+

This server requires players to be at least 18 years old. While we will make no efforts to screen users, if it becomes obvious you are not 18 at any point you will be banned.

## 6 Avoid Exposing Active Players in OOC

Feel free to discuss current rounds, but avoid explicitly selling out people still actively participating in the round or you may find yourself muted.

# Game-only Rules

## 7 No Hacking

Hacked client detections will result in bans with no questions asked and no questions answered.

## 8 Don't Ghost Metacomm

Metacomms are allowed within a certain degree of reason: You're free to group up and play with friends, even using voice chats to communicate while doing so, but don't be such a lame-ass that you're ghosting around just to pass information directly to your friends.

## 9 What is allowed

Whether you're a tryhard here to win, or trolling the tryhards with an explosive implanted plasma golem, if you're able to pull it off and it isn't against the rules above, go nuts! Lie to people to gain their trust and then stab them in the back! Metagrudge someone you recognize from previous rounds! Gang up with friends!

## 10 Accept the Adminbus

Admins exist to keep the game spicy and interesting - They are going to adminbus, and sometimes it is going to affect you in negative ways. This should almost never include directly targetted smites unless rules were broken, but it may include something such as turning that guy you lied to and backstabbed into a revenant so they can haunt you.

&nbsp;

# Administrator Policy

This is the minimum expectations for game administrators. Breaking any of these may result in reduction of privileges or other punishment as decided by the Host and Head Administrators.

## 1 Deadmin While Playing

You are de-adminned when you start playing for a reason - please remain this way while you are an active participant in any game. If you feel something is egregious enough to warrant an immediate response instead of waiting for round end, re-admin and immediately leave your body before handling it. You will be de-adminned upon returning to your body, if it is still alive.

## 2 Adminbus Policy

When dead or observing you are not only allowed, but encouraged to take an active hand in the ongoing round: Cancel events and trigger new ones as you see fit. Answer prayers and/or nudge things around a bit as well as you think will best keep the game more interesting for everyone.

Try to keep your responses measured with a degree of fairness in mind. The more powerful a form of intervention can be, the less targeted it should be. Directly giving someone a strong item spawn is bad, but announcing the drop location of the same powerful item is fine (especially if you wait for multiple people to show up before actually triggering the pod).

## 3 Do not take admin-spawned ghost roles

Any ghost roles introduced to the game by an admin (including forced random events) are forbidden from being taken by any admin, including those that are not the one spawning it in.
