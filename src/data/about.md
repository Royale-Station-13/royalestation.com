# What is the server?

Royale Station 13 is a fork of <a href="https://beestation13.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BeeStation</a>
based on the <a href="https://github.com/BeeStation/BeeStation-Hornet/pull/2803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Royale gamemode created by PowerfulBacon</a>. The gamemode has been heavily modified for more unique drops and better balance, as well as converted to the sole gamemode.

Players spawn with and find loot in crates, and must fight to the death. A death wall slowly shrinks the play area. The last surviving player wins the game.

# Staff

Royale Station 13 is created and hosted by Rukofamicom.

Currently, all staff are hand-picked and there is no application process.

- Rukofamicom: Host
- Itsmeowdev: Operator, Head Administrator
- Bastian0930: Administrator
- Liidero: Administrator

# Royale Features

## Gear

Players select gear from the BloodyCoin shop, customize their characters, and Ready Up. When the game starts, players spawn at their selected job's spawnpoint, wearing the default outfit, which includes an internals box with some tools and healing, along with any gear selected in the BloodyCoin shop.

Most purchaseable gear is weak, but gives players a chance to defend themselves roundstart. Further gear is looted from the station map and from supply crates that drop randomly throughout the station. Larger and more valuable loot drop locations are announced via station announcements, with some containing turrets to fend off players from the valuable loot within.

## The Wall

The Wall serves to keep gameplay within the station and incentivize _battle_. The wall will continously shrink until eventually filling the station.

Anything inside or behind the wall will instantly be gibbed, preventing "storm camping" as notoriously present in other battle royale games.

## Events

Midround antagonists and event weights are tweaked for the battle royale experience, with things like Radiation Storms and plasma anomalies being less common to make the events more fun for battle royale.

## Access

The Fighter ID grants access to almost all areas of the station, except for select areas including:

- Armory
- Warden's Office
- Captain's Office

This is to make it harder to gain access to powerful weapons by simply spawning near one of these areas and rushing. Instead, hacking and other forced entry are required.

## Other Modifications

Plasmaflooding is significantly harder, as most sources of plasma are entirely disabled or empty.

## Species

Players are allowed to select varying species for their characters, each with different advantages and disadvantages.

For example, skeletons are immune to atmospheric damage from space, and can heal by drinking milk, but are heavily susceptible to brute damage.
